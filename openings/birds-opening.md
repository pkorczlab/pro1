# Bird’s Opening



## Bird’s Opening

1.f4

The Bird’s opening is a flank opening from white’s perspective, starting with the move 1.f4.

### Bird’s Opening Basic Theory

The Bird’s Opening is named after British master Henry Edward Bird, who played the opening throughout his chess career in the mid-nineteenth century.

The Bird’s opening is an aggressive, imbalanced and rather unusual opening where white aims to control the e5-square, possibly with the help of a fianchettoed bishop on b2. The opening generally offers good attacking chances to white but comes at the cost of weakening their own king-side.

A popular response by black is 1… d5, known as the Dutch Variation of the Bird’s Opening.

### Bird’s Opening Dutch Variation

1.f4 d5 3.Nf3

If black responds with 1… d5, white usually plays 2.Nf3 and we reach the Dutch Variation of the Bird’s Opening.

In the Dutch Variation of the Bird’s Opening, white will essentially play the Dutch Defence with reversed colors. White can try to dominate the a1-h8 diagonal with a fianchettoed bishop on b2 (and pawns on e3 and f4). White can also opt for aKing’s-Indian setup(g3, Bg2, 0-0), with an attack on the black king-side.

Even though the move 1.f4 was mentioned by Lucena in a book from 1497, the opening was eventually named after the British master, Henry Bird, who first played it in 1855 and continued to do so for most of his career.

Top chess players probably feel there are better ways to utilize the first-move advantage, which is possibly why the Bird’s opening is not popular among them. Even so, elite grandmasters occasionally use it as a surprise weapon.

### The Pros and Cons of the Bird’s Defense

The Bird’s opening is a good choice for players who want attacking chances but don’t want to study too much theory. However, white’s king-safety will be compromised and if your opponent is well-prepared they will be able to equalize easily or even get an advantage against you.
