The opening is named after Howard Staunton, the famous English chess master who was widely recognized as an unofficial world champion from 1843-1851. In those years (1840’s-1850’s) his contemporaries believed the opening to be inferior, partly due to the pawn on c4 restricting the white light-square bishop.

### English Opening Basic Theory

The English Opening is an opening for white that starts with the move 1.c4. In a pure English opening, white will aim to control the d5-square, with the help of a bishop on g2 and another pawn on e4, supported by a pawn on d3.

However, the English opening often transposes into another opening, such as theQueen’s Gambitor theCatalan Opening.

Note:In chess, transposition is the scenario where the exact same position is reached, but by a different sequence of moves. For example, the English Opening will often transpose into a variation of the Queen’s Gambit.

A popular variation in the English Opening is the Anglo Indian Defense.

### The Pros and Cons of the English Opening

In the English Opening white settles for slower development in return for long-term pressure on the queen-side. However, since white’s development is slower, there are less chances for a direct attack and black may be able to get a strong hold in the centre.
