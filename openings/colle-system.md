## Colle System

1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3

The Colle System is an opening system for white, named after a Belgian chess master, Edgard Colle, who popularized this opening in the 1920’s. The setup is similar to the London System and the Torre Attack, but in the case of the Colle System the white dark-square bishop remains inside the pawn-chain.

A popular variation in the Colle System is the Traditional Colle (which actually refers to the way black chooses to respond, specifically to play c5, whilst white still goes for the standard Colle System setup).

However, a well-prepared opponent will have little difficulty in dealing with the Colle System, which is why it’s not very popular on the highest levels of play.
