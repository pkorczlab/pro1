# Vienna Game



## Vienna Game

1.e4 e5 2.Nc3

The Vienna Game is an opening for white. In the 1890’s, this opening was very popular in Vienna, Austria.

### Vienna Game Basic Theory

In the Vienna Game opening, white does not play the almost expected 2.Nf3, but instead develops the other knight, 3.Nc3, with the intent to possibly play f2-f4 on the 3rd move. In some variations then, the Vienna Game can be seen as a delayed King’s Gambit.

A popular variation in the Vienna Game is the Mieses Variation.

### Vienna Game Mieses Variation

1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3

Black’s most common response to 2.Nc3 is 2… Nf6 (the Falkbeer Variation), where top level players may feel that 3.f4 d5!? is too risky for white. White may decide to rather play 3.g3 to fianchetto his light-square bishop on the king-side, known as the Mieses Variation of the Vienna Game.

### The Pros and Cons of the Vienna Game

The Vienna Game sidesteps many of black’s opening choices and therefore avoids a lot of theory. White’s strategy is also fairly simple to execute. However, since 2.Nc3 doesn’t threaten anything (as compared to 2.Nf3 threatening 3.Nxe5) there is less pressure on black and they can be more flexible in how they choose to defend.

## Extra Information
**Description:** The Vienna Game is an opening in chess that begins with the moves: . 1. e4 e5 2. Nc3. White's second move is less common than 2.Nf3, and is also more recent. The original idea behind the Vienna Game was to play a delayed King's Gambit with f4 (the Vienna Gambit), but in modern play White often plays more quietly (for example, by fianchettoing their king's bishop with g3 and Bg2).
