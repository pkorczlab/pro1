## Dutch Defense

1.d4 f5

The Dutch Defense is an opening for black, named after Elias Stein, born in 1748. He became a Dutch chess master who recommended 1… f5 as the best reply to 1.d4.

### Dutch Defense Basic Theory

With 1… f5, black aims to dominate the light-squares, fundamentally the e4-square. The thinking is that since white played 1.d4, the e4-square becomes a sensible target. Black will also have flexibility as to how they will play in the centre with the d-and-e-pawns. However, black must accept that 1… f5 weakens their king-side.

A popular variation in the Dutch Defense is the Fianchetto Attack.

### Dutch Defense Fianchetto Attack

1.d4 f5 2.g3 Nf6

The fianchetto attack refers to white’s idea to play g3 and Bg2. Understanding that black takes aim at the e4-square, white immediately enlists their light-square bishop to support the centre.

### The Pros and Cons of the Dutch Defense

The Dutch Defense leads to imbalanced positions and gives black the opportunity to try original ideas. However, due to playing … f5 early on, black’s king-safety will be compromised and white might enjoy a space-advantage in the centre.
