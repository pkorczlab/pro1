### Benko Gambit Basic Theory

The Benko Gambit, also known as the Volga Gambit or the Volga-Benko Gambit (named after Pal Benko and the Volga River), is agambit openingfrom black’s perspective.

The Benko Gambit is a rather unique response to 1.d4 where black wants to sacrifice a pawn in the hope to obtain lasting pressure–through active pieces and open files on the queen-side. Black’s strategy is then further enhanced by placing a fianchettoed bishop on g7 which can potentially heap immense pressure on white’s queenside. Black should approach these ideas energetically–or else risk losing the initiative if white finds the time to organize a solid defense.

If white declines the gambit then the game will likely enter a position resembling theBenoni Defense, and offers black a completely playable position. However, a popular response for white is to accept the gambit, leading to the Benko Gambit Accepted variation.

However, white can always decline the gambit and they have many options to choose from. If you play the Benko Gambit, you will likely get exciting opportunities against all but the most experienced opponents.
