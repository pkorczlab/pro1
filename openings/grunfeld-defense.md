# Grünfeld Defense



## Grünfeld Defense

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5

The Grünfeld Defense is an opening for black, named after Ernst Grünfeld, an Austrian chess player who, in 1922, defeated future world champion, Alexander Alekhine, with this opening.

### Grünfeld Defense Basic Theory

In typical hypermodern style, black invites white to attack the centre with their pawns (classical style). Black then seeks to aggressively counter-attack white’s centre with the d7-d5 push and their minor pieces.

A popular variation in the Grünfeld Defense is the Exchange Variation.

### Grünfeld Defense Exchange Variation

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5

In the Grünfeld Defense Exchange Variation, white exchanges the pawn on d5, with the idea to follow up with e2-e4, dominating the centre with their pawns. In the ensuing battle, white will aim to demonstrate that the classical school of thinking (occupy the centre with your pawns) is wise. Black, on the other hand, will seek to prove that the hypermodern school of thinking (allow your opponent to occupy the centre–then undermine them) is also good.

### The Pros and Cons of the Grünfeld Defense

The Grünfeld Defense is a highly theoretical in nature. This implies that either player can benefit from experience and superior knowledge of the opening. Black may be able to get a very active position whereas white could obtain a strong centre and space advantage.

## Extra Information
**Description:** The Grünfeld Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves: . 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5. Black offers White the possibility of 4.cxd5, which may be followed by 4...Nxd5 and 5.e4, giving White an imposing central pawn duo. If White does not take the d5-pawn, Black may eventually play ...dxc4, when a White response of e4 again leads to the same pawn structure.
