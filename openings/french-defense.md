# French Defense



## French Defense

1.e4 e6

The French Defense is an opening for black, so named after a correspondence match played between the city of London and the city of Paris, in 1834.

### French Defense Basic Theory

In the French defense the purpose of black’s first move, e6, is to support the d5-square from where black intends to challenge the centre. Also, by playing e6, black’s king is immediately safer since white will not be able to attack on the g8-a2-diagonal anytime soon.

A popular variation in the French Defense is the Winawer Variation.

### French Defense Winawer Variation

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4

A main idea in the French Defense is that the black pawn on d5 attacks the e4-square. The Winawer variation further supports this idea by pinning the white knight on c3.

### The Pros and Cons of the French Defense

The French Defense is a very popular opening because it is fairly easy to learn, very solid and even offers attacking possibilities. However, the French Defense leaves black with a locked in light-squared bishop. (There are ways to deal with it though.)
