### Alekhine’s Defense Basic Theory

The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, the fourth world champion, who played it in two of his games in a tournament in Budapest, 1921.

Alekhine’s Defense is ahypermodern openingfrom black’s perspective. Black dares white to grab space in the center with the moves 2.e5 Nd5 3.c4. Black then intends to attack and undermine white’s central pawns. However, if white manages to effectively support their central pawns, white will enjoy a strong advantage in the center.

A common variation in the Alekhine Defense Opening is The Modern Variation.

In the Alekhine Defense Modern Variation white takes a more cautious approach. White doesn’t play 4.c4 and, instead, supports the centre with 4.Nf3.

### The Pros and Cons of Alekhine’s Defense

Since white’s options are limited against Alekhine’s Defense you can force your opponent to play the opening on your terms. You might even get an advantage if your inexperienced opponent is tempted to make too many pawn moves. However, if you fail to properly execute your strategy, your opponent will enjoy a strong centre and your position will be cramped.

Note:When the word “defense” appears in the name of an opening, such as Alekhine’s Defense, it usually refers to a choice of opening by black. Ironically though, in many cases the use of the word “defense” can be quite misleading, I.e. the Sicilian Defense is a very aggressive opening.



## Extra Information
**Description:** History. Alexander Alekhine first played Alekhine's Defense at Budapest in 1921, scoring a win and a draw, and continued playing it during the 1920s. Alekhine did not create the opening, and games from the 19th century that begin with 1.e4 Nf6 can be found, but his use popularized it. Alekhine. Photo: Wikimedia, public domain.
