# Petrov’s Defense



## Petrov’s Defense

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6

Petrov’s Defense (or Petroff Defense) is an opening for black, named after Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player, who popularized the opening in the mid-19th century. He discovered this opening is playable if black meets 3.Nxe5 with 3…d6 before …Nxe4.

### Petrov’s Defense Basic Theory

By keeping the game absolutely symmetrical, black can achieve a very solid, albeit drawish, position. In high-level games, black will usually play the Petrov only if they will be happy with a draw. The player with the black pieces may also use this opening if they want to tempt their opponent to overreach.

A popular variation in Petrov’s Defense is the Classical Variation.

### Petrov’s Defense Classical Variation

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6

3… d6 is the move that Alexander Petrov discovered. Previously, the moves 3… Nxe4? 4.Qe2! Nf6?? 5.Nc6+! made black believe that this opening is terrible for black. However, after 3… d6 4.Nf3, black can safely play 4… Nxe4 and restore the balance in material.

### The Pros and Cons of the Petrov’s Defense

The Petrov’s Defense is a very solid opening for black and a surprising amount of theory exists in some lines. It will be very difficult for white to get any advantage from the opening. However, it is not a good choice if black is playing for a win because white can easily force black into very drawish positions.
