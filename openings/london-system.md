## London System

1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Bf4

The London System is an opening system for white, named after the 1922 London tournament–where the opening became prominent.

### London System Basic Theory

In The London System (also known as the Mason Variation of the Queen’s Pawn Game), white sticks to the same setup, almost regardless of what Black plays. As with all opening systems, the theory and move order is not as important as it would be in non-system type openings.

White will give a lot of support to their pawn on d4 (c3,e3,Nf3). Their pawn-formation in the centre will exert substantial control over the dark squares. Since black’s dark-square bishop will play an important role in defending dark squares, white will often aim to exchange their dark-square bishop for its black counterpart, quite possibly on d6.

A popular variation in the London System is the Main Line.

Note:The Main Line Variation of a particular opening may not always remain the most popular. The popularity of opening variations can change over time. Top-level trends, new discoveries, novelties or refutations of existing variations can all affect its popularity.

### London System Main Line

1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Bf4 c5 4.e3

With the moves 1.d4 2.Nf3 & 3.Bf4, white revealed they want to play the London System. The traditional continuation is then 3… c5 4.e3, known as the London System Main Line. A more modern approach is to play 2.Bf4, on the second move, committing to the London System one move earlier.

### The Pros and Cons of the London System

Being a System Opening, the London System is easy to learn and there isn’t much black can do to avoid it. It is a reliable way for white to get a satisfactory position. However, black is not under any immediate pressure and it might not be clear how white can obtain an initiative.

## Extra Information
**Description:** The London System is an opening system in chess where White opens with 1.d4 and develops the dark-squared bishop to f4, then supports the d4-pawn with pawns on e3 and c3. The other bishop is developed to d3 (or occasionally e2) and the knights typically to f3 and d2. This set-up often results in a closed game.The London System can be used against virtually any Black defence and thus comprises ...
